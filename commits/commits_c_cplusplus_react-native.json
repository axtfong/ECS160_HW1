      "message": "Run flingAndSnap logic from ACTION_SCROLL events (#54226)\n\nSummary:\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/54226\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/54226\n\nJoysticks, mouse wheels, and trackpads can issue an `ACTION_SCROLL` event when performing scroll. However, the `ACTION_SCROLL` generic motion event does not run the post touch runnable and paging/snap alignment is not honored when these events are received. To fix this, both ScrollView implementations should call `handlePostTouchScrolling` with a 0 velocity, ensuring that momentum events are sent, fabric scroll state is updated, and `flingAndSnap` is properly called to align to a page.\n\nThis change adds some checks to queue a runnable that calls `handlePostTouchScrolling` after no more `ACTION_SCROLL` events are received in the same 20ms delay it uses to determine a stable frame. The end result is that snap alignments are correctly honored\n\nChangelog: [Android][Fixed] - Controller-driven scroll events now honor paging/snap alignment\n\nReviewed By: javache\n\nDifferential Revision: D85172309\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 5818777b3c371b3da4aa925a8c840e0da89bf6a4",

However, such helpers have proven very useful for the `jsinspector-modern` C++ test suite. The out-of-the-box ergonomics *are* pretty bad, though, so this diff tries to improve the situation.\n\nThe biggest offender in our test suite is the `expectMessageFromPage` helper function - if a test fails because an expectation isn\u0027t met, the error message points to the `EXPECT_CALL` line inside `expectMessageFromPage`, which is utterly useless compared to the line of test code that *called* `expectMessageFromPage`.\n\nHere, we reach into gmock\u0027s internals slightly to create a variant of the `EXPECT_CALL` macro that allows passing in a [`std::source_location`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/source_location.html) (thanks, C++20!). We then teach `expectMessageFromPage` and other such helpers to capture a source location at the call site (using a parameter with a default value to `source_location::current()`) and use the modified macro to pass it into gmock.\n\nReviewed By: huntie\n\nDifferential Revision: D84368993\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 62f64b6c5f626a54bc3da7143d84ee2d75d16ac6",

Interval tree\u0027s query allows us to lower the frequently-used updateModes() operation from `O(n)` to `O(m + log n)`, where `m` is the number of VirtualViews in the hysteresis range. General layout changes incur a penalty due to the requirement of maintaining a balanced BST.\n\nPerformance Changes:\n* updateModes(): `O(n) -\u003e O(m + log n)` (new algo)\n* updateMode(): `O(1) -\u003e O(1)`\n* add VV: `O(1) -\u003e O(log n)`\n* update VV: `O(1) -\u003e O(log n)`\n* delete VV: `O(1) -\u003e O(log n)`\n\nWe expect scrolling to be much more frequent than a total layout change/updating many of the elements in the container at once. However, the initial load of a page will take `O(n log n)` time rather than `O(n)` time.\n\nWe also include some bookkeeping sets for \"old\" hysteresis, prerender, and visible VVs. This will increase the memory footprint of `VirtualViewContainerState` by `O(m)`.\n\nMore details are in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cmamx6fNfruoHLApX8tedqNVZsCEUyoBvQWpMvBsfcY/edit?tab\u003dt.gqla6vu3231k.\n\n### Note\nThis diff only covers the Android version. iOS may follow after experimentation.\n\nReviewed By: lunaleaps\n\nDifferential Revision: D83783201\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 93a7a93784d668e09d8ddacc7e30d289ccd8b7a2",

Currently i\u0027ve added CSS syntax testcases. Checkout `CSSBackgroundImageTest.cpp`\n\n### Verify example screens in RNTester\n- Set `enableNativeCSSParsing` to true in `ReactNativeFeatureFlags.config.js` and run `yarn featureflags --update`\n- Rebuild the project and verify `LinearGradientExample` and `RadialGradientExample` screens on both platforms.\n\n### Notes\n- Currently it is difficult to run CSS renderer tests. I made a custom cmake config to get it working, some steps would be helpful.\n- Right now the new CSS renderer seems to be only working on iOS. NickGerleman mentioned there is some WIP to get it working on android. So please test this PR on iOS.\n\nReviewed By: mdvacca\n\nDifferential Revision: D83341309\n\nPulled By: javache\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 91b88e3df164766c1f0021283697b1e5f9b44bfc",

      "message": "Improve decoding full-sized images in `RCTImageLoader` (#54184)\n\nSummary:\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/54184\n\nIn Expo, someone reported (https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/40158) that `expo-image-manipulator` causes memory crashes when processing large images (\u003e 30MB).\nImage manipulator uses `RCTImageLoader` to load and decode images. As opposed to the Image component, it always requests for images in full size. For large images it may crash at `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` which in the provided repro slowly increases memory usage until it finally crashes after a few seconds of running.\nI figured out that not including the `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize` option works much better, but using `CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex` instead of `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` works even better – it\u0027s faster and consumes less memory during decoding. This is more or less what `SDWebImage` library does, see [`SDImageIOAnimatedCoder`](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/SDWebImage/Core/SDImageIOAnimatedCoder.m#L488-L509).\nWith the proposed changes, it\u0027s still crashing but only for the largest image (64MB), other images (40MB and 50MB) are now working fine. Obviously, it cannot be fixed entirely and it\u0027s not recommended to load such big images without downscaling them.\n\n## Changelog:\n\n[IOS] [CHANGED] - Use `CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex` instead of `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` to decode full-sized images\n\nPull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/54127\n\nTest Plan: I\u0027ve tested the examples of the `Image` component in RNTester as well as the repro provided in https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/40158\n\nReviewed By: javache\n\nDifferential Revision: D84835416\n\nPulled By: cipolleschi\n\nfbshipit-source-id: a182dd00f00194f0463ad4f583cc695647414fca",
