However, such helpers have proven very useful for the `jsinspector-modern` C++ test suite. The out-of-the-box ergonomics *are* pretty bad, though, so this diff tries to improve the situation.\n\nThe biggest offender in our test suite is the `expectMessageFromPage` helper function - if a test fails because an expectation isn\u0027t met, the error message points to the `EXPECT_CALL` line inside `expectMessageFromPage`, which is utterly useless compared to the line of test code that *called* `expectMessageFromPage`.\n\nHere, we reach into gmock\u0027s internals slightly to create a variant of the `EXPECT_CALL` macro that allows passing in a [`std::source_location`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/source_location.html) (thanks, C++20!). We then teach `expectMessageFromPage` and other such helpers to capture a source location at the call site (using a parameter with a default value to `source_location::current()`) and use the modified macro to pass it into gmock.\n\nReviewed By: huntie\n\nDifferential Revision: D84368993\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 62f64b6c5f626a54bc3da7143d84ee2d75d16ac6",
